"""No-silent-network gate (GATE-9).

Every outbound network call in Quill must be deliberate, reviewed, and tied to
an explicit user action or an explicitly consented background check. This gate
inventories every egress call site in the ``quill`` package via AST and fails if
a new one appears that is not recorded in ``_REVIEWED_EGRESS`` with a rationale.

The rationale for each site documents *what triggers it* and *why it is not a
silent call* (a user action, a visible progress/consent surface, or an opt-in
setting). A reviewer adding a new network call must add it here, which forces a
conscious decision and a code-review touchpoint.

This is the structural half of GATE-9. The runtime half — asserting the AI chat
path shows provider, model, and scope before any cloud call — lands with the
provider-wiring work (AI-13), where that call path first exists.
